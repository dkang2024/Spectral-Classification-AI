# Spectral-Classification-AI

This repository contains a machine learning model trained to classify stars using an image of them and the stars' fluxes. The machine learning model has an accuracy of 95%, compared to the accuracy given by a regular calculation of about 40%. The machine learning model is a combination of a Random Forest Classifier, Convolutional Neural Network, and Multi-Layer Perceptron. 

## IMPORTANT

**When running the files, DO NOT run the cells immediately below "Generated Data Completion" and the one that shuffles the dataset. Both of these cells are in Dataset.ipynb, and they will reshuffle the dataset, which will completely mess up the link between the images and their specific classifications. THESE CELLS WILL STILL HAVE SAFEGUARDS, SO IF YOU HAPPEN TO RUN THEM, ANSWER "N" WHEN PROMPTED**

Please enjoy!
