# Spectral-Classification-AI

This repository contains a machine learning model trained to classify stars using an image of them and the stars' fluxes. The machine learning model has an accuracy of 95%, compared to the accuracy given by a regular calculation of about 40%. The machine learning model is a combination of a Random Forest Classifier, Convolutional Neural Network, and Multi-Layer Perceptron. Please enjoy!
